# WARM-Thrifting-Site

As a group of developers we want to create a website that allows users to search for free or upcycled items around columbus, Ohio area. When they search for these items they should be presented with the current local weather as well as a list of items that denotes, how far they have to travel, what the item is, a picture of the item (if available) and a description.
