# WARM-Thrifting-Site

We are WARM development and this is our first group project for the OSU coding bootcamp. The site is designed to portray our skills using third party api's, css frameworks, and general website coding. 

Trash to treasure is a site that allows users to search for free or upcycled items in central Ohio. The site also displays the day's current weather allowing users to determine whether or not they want to leave their homes for the item.
