This is a group project that creates a favorite stock tracker that end users can interact with. 



As  a group of developers we want to create a website that allows users to track a group of favorited stocks.
When a user selects a stock THEN
the stock should appear in a pane in the main body of the page. THEN
the user should be able to save this stock in a list of favorited stocks for later viewing. THEN
when the user reloads the page they should be able to view this list.
When the user loads the page they should be listed with market intraday prices for global stock market performance leaders.
